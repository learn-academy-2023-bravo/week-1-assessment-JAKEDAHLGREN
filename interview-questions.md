# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: Git is a type of storage, and Github is a cloud based repository service that stores your git projects, and allows you to collaborate with other developers.

Researched answer:(resource:https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/git-tutorial/what-is-git) 
Git is a version control system that allows multiple developers to add code to the same project through seperate branches. This is extremely helpful because there are multiple levels of safety to protect your main code source. It has the ability to track the project and let all the developers to see who has made changes. It also allows all of the developers working on the project to have their own copy on their local computer. This allows more communication between the developing team, and a clear log of who, what, where, and when the document was altered or accessed.

GitHub is a company that will store your git projects and all types of open sourced code in a cloud-based repository. It gives you and your team access to git for ease of collaboration, and version control to track all edits, deletions, and merges to your project in a central hub. Github allows you to push your teams edited code from your local system to a specific repository, and make sure there are no coding conflicts before you merge all of your branches. 

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer: The JavaScript operator that will return the primitive data type Boolean is a statement that requires a return of true or false. I think the qualifiers are "or" || "and" &&.

Researched answer:(resource:https://www.educba.com/boolean-operators-in-javascript/) Boolean is returned for logic operators. logic operaters, such as "and" or "or" statements, will return a true or false answer. It doesn't have to strictly say true, but if the answer can be considered true the value is called "truthy". Conversly, if the answer can be considered false the value is called a "falsy"

3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

Your answer: An index is a collection of data such as a array. The difference between index and value is that an index would be refering to the location/placement of the data within its container, and the value would be the actual data represented.

Researched answer:(resourcehttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array) Index is a space saver for a specific piece of data, and always starts tracking data from the 0 position. Ex: var Array =[1, 2, 3, 4], in the is array 1 has an index of 0, 2 index of 1, 3 index of 2, 4 index of 3. The values of is array would be the number that is actually represented within the array. 1=1,2=2,3=3,4=4. So value is the actual data, where index is the placement of that data in a specific container(such as an array or string).

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: Strings and Arrays are both collections of data that are indexed within a container. Arrays are contained within [], where as Strings are contained within "". Arrays have the ability to hold any type of data type, whereas strings can only store characters.

Researched answer:(resource:https://pediaa.com/what-is-the-difference-between-array-and-string) A string is defined by "", and is a collection of characters followed by null. Arrays are defined by [], and can store multiple data types. Arrays tend to have a fixed size, while strings can have a variable number of elements. in an array you can generally access random indivual elements, but in strings are usually processed sequentially character by character. 

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: To properly pair program there will be one driver, and one navigator. The driver will be sharing their screen and typing out the code. The navigator will be telling the driver what code to type, while paying close attention to the shared screen to catch any typing errors, or formatting issues. After a set amount of time or a preset progress benchmark has been completed, the pair will switch roles. This helps keep people on track, helps create better code, and helps with productivity.

Researched answer:(resource:https://www.jscamp.app/docs/blogging-03/#:~:text=Pair%20programming%20is%20a%20programming,thinks%20about%20coding%20in%20detail.)
Paired programming lets you write source code created by a collaboritive effort between a pair of developers. One controls the computer and focuses on coding details, while the other programer looks at the big picture/goals and continually checks the drivers code for errors. It keeps people honest, code is reviewed by multiple eyes before it gets submitted, collective code ownership, you can work remotely with your partner, and errors are caught more quickly saving time and money.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: This is a function that accepts functions as parameters and/or returns a function.

2. Jest: is a JavaScript testing framework desined to ensure correctness of any JavaScript codebase. It allows you to write tests easily and quickly.

3. Objects: a standalone entity, with properties and type. This example compairs it to a cup... a cup has a color, a design, weight, and material it is made of, etc. the same way a JavaScript objects can have properties, which define their characteristics. objects can combine variables, functions, and data structures. It stores value.

4. Method: is a function which is a property of an object. two types: instance - built-in tasks performed by an object instance, or Static - which are tasks that are called directly on an object constructor.

5. Classes: encapsulate data with code to work on that data, they are a template for creating objects. built on prototypes, but also have some syntax and semantics that are unique to themselves.
